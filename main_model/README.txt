The "/main_model" folder is where ALL Aspen model files (*.apw, *.bkp, etc) go. This includes all save files for the main simulations for the project. 

General file name scheme should be (subject to change):
"main_<team_member>_<version#>"

MODEL TESTS (i.e. specific processes for the main model) SHOULD NOT GO HERE!
They should go in the "/main_model/processes" folder!

Before committing to the develop or main branch, copy all files to their designated backup folder detailed with the proper date.
