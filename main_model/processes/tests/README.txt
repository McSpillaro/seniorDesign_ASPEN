The "/tests" folder is for generating tests for validating or benchmarking specific areas of the project (i.e. testing heat recovery for something or for a mass balance validation).

General naming scheme could be as follows (subject to change):
"<purpose>_<version#>_<team_member>"

Examples: 
validate-mass-balance_v1_omar
test-heat-recovery_v2_rumzi

Before committing to the develop or main branch, copy all files to their designated backup folder detailed with the proper date.
