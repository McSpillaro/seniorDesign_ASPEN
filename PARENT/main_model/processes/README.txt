The "./PARENT/main_model/processes" folder is designated solely for designing a specific process which will be later applied to the main model *.apw file after finalization. Testing for specifics will go in the "/tests" subfolder.

General naming scheme (subject to change):
<process>_<version#>_<team_member>

Examples of naming:
h2s-scavenger_v3_rumzi
iC4-hydrogenation_v2_drake

Before committing to the develop or main branch, copy all files to their designated backup folder detailed with the proper date.
